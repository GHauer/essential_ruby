# Line 1 effectively copy-pastes in any code you wrote in challenge_1.rb

# Below is an array of hashes. Each hash in the array represents one rate quote from a bank.

# Given some parameters of the loan, perhaps entered by a user on a web form:

# Now, loop through the array of loan quotes using .each:
#   For each option, tell the user how much the monthly payment will be to that bank.
#   Re-use the pmt method that you defined in Challenge 1.
